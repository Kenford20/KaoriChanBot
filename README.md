# Konnichiwa! I'm Kaori-chan :)

Kaori-chan is a chat bot made for Telegram, which is a popular, cloud based instant messaging application. I've been using Telegram for many years now and I've always loved it. She is one of my side projects that I've decided to work on for my own personal development, practice, and fun of course!

## *Technologies used*
* Kaori-chan is mainly developed using JavaScript. 
* A simple Node Express server is set up to host her logic. 
* I personally have this server deployed to Heroku, which is an awesome, easy to use, cloud platform as a service that provides many application management/hosting services and supports several popular programming languages.
* mathjs library is used to handle calculator operations
* fetch API and axios are used to make http requests

## *APIs*
Kaori-chan utilizes several APIs to help her retrieve the necessary data for her users. 
Big thanks to the following:

## How does she work?
An instance of a Telegram bot is initialized with the unique token you are given when you create a bot with `BotFather`. This instance then listens to the chat through either *polling* or *Webhooks*, from which you can handle these messages with your server side code. 

Now how does your server get access to the telegram messages? 

The Telegram Bot API acts as an intermediary service that takes updates from the chat and makes them available to your server side code. If your bot needs to communicate back to the users, you continue to use the Bot API to send any messages/prompts/questions to it and it will forward them back to the chat.

This back and forth communication between the telegram application, the Bot API, and your server describes the general flow of data within a telegram chat with its users and bots.
