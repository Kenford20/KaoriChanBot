# Konnichiwa! I'm Kaori-chan :)

Kaori-chan is a chat bot made for Telegram, which is a popular, cloud based instant messaging application. I've been using Telegram for many years now and I've always loved it. She is one of my side projects that I've decided to work on for my own personal development, practice, and fun of course!
